Recursion


[Practice question] The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.


Given n, calculate F(n).


Example 1:

Input: n = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.


Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: 3

Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.


[Practice Question] Given a positive integer, write a recurssive function that returns true if the given number is a palindrome, else false. For example, 12321 is a palindrome, but 1451 is not a palindrome

[5 points] You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


Example 1:


Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.

1 step + 1 step
2 steps

        Example 2:

Input: n = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.

1 step + 1 step + 1 step
1 step + 2 steps
2 steps + 1 step
